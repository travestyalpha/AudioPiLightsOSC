Code to control my lights and Audio through OSC on the Raspberry Pi
Using Python 2.7 code

I am creating a control method to allow the Raspberry Pi to control Arduino over USB Serial to create both audio and have control over lighting controlled via OSC. This may branch out to DMX (not attempted), and MIDI (already working with midi files on another project and may merge here shortly.

Not worrying about efficient or clean code yet, just trying to get everything working together.

Other ideas - an interface of some sort (though command line is okay with me), and a mobile app possible, but this may not be necessary due to the point of OSC in the first place.

By extension of the "Christmas Lights" control, this could also be used as a simple live performance tool for lighting control/automation.
